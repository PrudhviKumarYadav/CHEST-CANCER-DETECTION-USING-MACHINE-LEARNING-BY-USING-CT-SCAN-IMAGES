# CHEST-CANCER-DETECTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING-BY-USING-CT-SCAN-IMAGES
The dataset of CT scan images are taken from kaggle.com.Dataset contain 3 chest cancer types which are Adenocarcinoma,Large cell carcinoma, Squamous cell carcinoma , and 1 folder for the normal cell Data folder is the main folder that contain all the step folders inside Data folder are test , train , valid.
1.Adenocarcinoma:
Adenocarcinoma of the lung: Lung adenocarcinoma is the most common form of lung cancer accounting for 30 percent of all cases overall and about 40 percent of all non-small cell lung cancer occurrences. Adenocarcinomas are found in several common cancers, including breast, prostate and colorectal. Adenocarcinomas of the lung are found in the outer region of the lung in glands that secrete mucus and help us breathe.
Symptoms include coughing, hoarseness, weight loss and weakness.
2.Large cell carcinoma:
Large-cell undifferentiated carcinoma: Large-cell undifferentiated carcinoma lung cancer grows and spreads quickly and can be found anywhere in the lung. This type of lung cancer usually accounts for 10 to 15 percent of all cases of NSCLC. Large-cell undifferentiated carcinoma tends to grow and spread quickly.
3.Squamous cell carcinoma:
Squamous cell: This type of lung cancer is found centrally in the lung, where the larger bronchi join the trachea to the lung, or in one of the main airway branches.Squamous cell lung cancer is responsible for about 30 percent of all non-small.
